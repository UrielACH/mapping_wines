These produce some of the best sherry-style wines in Spain, but remove the terroir of the vineyard through the ageing process. With Tres Miradas, they followed the Burgundian classification by producing one village wine, and three single vineyards or \"crus.\""

Spanish wine aficionados who consider Navarra strictly a source for bulk wines would do well to reflect on what owner Juan Maga\u00f1a has accomplished. Thirty years ago, Juan had a vision. After researching the best wines in the world, he decided to grow Bordeaux grapes in Navarra. He bought Merlot cuttings from a nursery that sold to famous ch\u00e2teaux in St. Emilion and Pomerol, most notably the hallowed Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus. A pioneer in Navarra, over the years Juan's bodega has become a reference point for quality in the region.  At once, Baron shows power and bright flavors with no green characters, with a structure that is integrated and harmonious. The southern district of Navarra has limestone that imparts characters of minerality and acidity that are unique to this place. Of the varieties grown on the estate, Merlot is best able to capture the minerality of the soil. "

It is a sizeable effort with extremely ripe tannin, something only old vine, late harvested Mourvedre can achieve. It is a custom cuvee created only for the American marketplace, so bottles sold in Europe and in the grey market will be completely different. Enjoy it over the next 2-3 years, although my instincts suggest it will last longer.\""

Its nose preserves the character which defines this harvest: the fruit a rung below the dominant ripeness which mingles with hints of liqueurs which you can only find in this wine and not in the rest of the range from the same vintage. The tertiary aromas come through in the form of leather and very faint hints of cloves and mountain herbs. It is on the palate that it reveals its greatest strengths: fruit you can almost chew, soft, silky tannin, a good level of acidity and infinite mineral nuances. The synergy of these sensations creates a really powerful impact on the taster. The features detected in direct olfaction are repeated in retro-olfaction, but almost in reverse order. The fruit, now a little riper, comes to the fore, the spices from the oak and the mountain herbs rise to the same level and the hints of liqueur disappear."

These wines amaze you with their great flavor from the first sip, the seemingly precocious integration of the tannins, the freshness of their \"Atlantic\" features interwoven with the more mature \"Mediterranean\" character. If you look for the words to describe the wine we can come up with ripe fruit, without reaching the dried fruit stage, mainly small red berries and plums, followed by balsamic notes, especially mint and licorice, and then, right at the end, hints of spices in the pepper, clove and vanilla range gently coming through. In retro-olfaction spices like tobacco and vanilla make a strong impression. Then, very subtle milky nuances evolve, followed by noble leather. All perfectly integrated in glorious harmony. A very pleasant mouth-feel with the sweetness of fine lees, pastries and soft, noble tannin. "

The name Vico pays tribute to Patrick Mata's older brother, Victor, a lawyer who resides in southern Spain's town of Marbella and a person with an abiding fascination with the unique expressions of terroir found throughout Spain. Vico may be Ra\u00fal's most extreme wine and it's strongly suggested that you decant it if you drink it within five years of the vintage. Ra\u00fal P\u00e9rez is one of Spain's finest winemakers and some wine trade veterans believe Ra\u00fal is among a handful of the best winemakers in the world. Ra\u00fal believes great wines are made in the vineyard and he has an uncanny knack for knowing what his vineyards need to achieve their greatest potential. As his great talent has become known, many winemakers now seek to collaborate with Raul."

The soil is the reason that the winery committed themselves to purchasing 95 hectares (228 acres) of vineyards, located at an altitude of 660 meters (1980 ft) above sea level, with an average age of 40 years. The sandy soils (up to 1 meter in depth) have an underlayment of large river stones, with a lot of iron, clay, and chalk. The vines produce very low yields of 1-2 kgs of grapes per vine. Winters are very cold; summers are hot with cool nights and it is a very arid climate. The Spanish enologist, Rafael Ca\u00f1izares seeks to achieve the maximum expression of the Tempranillo grape grown in the environment. The grapes for this wine come a single vineyard of 29 hectares (72 acres) that was planted in 1967 and only, after very careful vineyard selections, the best vines of Tempranillo grapes are hand harvested. Malolactic fermentation in barrel. Aged 14 months in new French oak barrels. "

The aroma is unveiled with an intensity that is not very frequent in the wines from the Ribera del Duero designation of origin. It appears with hints of roast from the grape and top-quality wood. On the palate, the sweetened tannins of the concentrated black fruits blend with the dry creamy tannins of the French oak. It is full of flavor, strong, fleshy and unfolds a truly suggestive range of tastes."

There is a supple mouth-feel and generous cherry and black fruit flavors and enough ripe tannins to ensure good longevity. Drink this hedonistic effort now and over the next 10-12 years.\""

Here Jordi relies on extremely low yields and optimal harvesting times to keep good acidity in the wines before allowing them to ferment with natural yeasts in stainless steel tanks. The key to the white is allowing the Garnacha Blanca to rest on its fine lees during the cold winter, a technique that helps to impart a lovely creaminess to the wine."

The 60- to 100 year-old vines yield less than one ton per acre, resulting in a most concentrated, unique expression of this variety and of the Bierzo terroir.  A classic vintage in the appellation. The wines have rich fruit, fresh personalities, and show great structure."

With Tempranillo forming the backbone of Spain's most famous wines, the La Vi\u00f1a Cooperative in Valencia planted Tempranillo widely with the goal of reproducing some of the qualities of those famous wines. This project would not be possible without the wealth of vineyards and range of altitudes the coop has planted. Contrary to popular opinion that Valencia is too warm for Tempranillo, the cooperative has planted the varietal at a range of altitudes from 300 to nearly 900 meters above sea level, at these high altitudes, the Tempranillo ripens slowly developing a tremendous aromatic potential. The lower altitude vines take advantage of cooling sea breezes and the higher altitude vines cooler night to maintain and develop those aromatic qualities. The reason Cabernet Sauvignon is blended into the wine is to allow for a stylistic continuity vintage to vintage.  "

In Portugal, the Merenzao grape takes the name of Bastardo and in France, specifically in the Jura region, it takes the name of Trousseau. Menc\u00eda provides body and Garnacha Tintorera (also known as Alicante Bouschet) contributes dark pigmentation and acidity. The vineyards of this rare wine are very near the cliffs of the Sil River, hence the name Escalada Do Sil. Valdeorras is known for its altitude and mineral soils composed of slate and granite. The region is in between Bierzo and Ribeira Sacra, but its climate is very different. Its higher elevation brings cooler nights and mornings, producing grapes with uplifted tones and refined tannins. If you are a lover of Cru Beaujolais, we recommend that you try Escalada Do Sil."

The majority of the Albarino vines are upwards of 180 years old. The soil is pure granite, thus phylloxera never made a home there. The vineyard is so old that the pergola is far lower than usual, reflecting the lower average height of the people in the mid-19th century. The wine is fermented with indigenous yeasts and aged on the lees for a year in 3000L foudre. Like many of the wines at Forjas de Salnes, the joint project from Raul Perez and Rodri Mendez, the finished wine here contains about 20% by volume of the previous vintage\u2019s joven wine that had been reserved in foudre. This blending (which is permissible in the Rias Baixas D.O.) takes some of the sting out of the young wine, rounding the edges of the granite-bred acid and giving the wine breadth in the mouth."

After he passed away, his two sons Joan and Josep took over, under the guidance of their mother Merc\u00e8. Since then, they have been working on defining their own style and putting their unique mark on the wines. This process has led to numerous developments. One is the conversion to biodynamics: the 2012 vintage was the first to be certified by Demeter. Others include the introduction of techniques such as crushing by foot and de-stemming only partially. There are also changes in aging vessels: the use of new wood is being dramaticallyreduced in favor of older barrels, foudres, and cement tanks. And the brothers are focusing less on Syrah and more on Grenache (or \"Granatxa,\" the old Catalan name for the grape), a grape with a longer history in this region."

The vineyards farmed to make Papa are full of slate and granite, and the wine shows assertive aromas of rosemary, thyme, and oregano, underscored by a firm mineral character. "
